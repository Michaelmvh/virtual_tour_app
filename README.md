# Virtual Tour App

## Purpose

This app is meant to make college campuses more accessible for people due to covid19, out of state students, or students with disabilities. Through this project I learned about: the dart programming language, Flutter, UI layouts, asynchronous programming, and noSQL databases.

## Overview

The homescreen prompts users to select a school to 'tour'. The campuses are loaded from the firestore database.

After selecting a campus, users will be brought to the map page with markers for the notable locations. Users can zoom in and out using gestures or the buttons.

Tapping on a marker will bring up a pop-up with an image and the name of the locaiton.

Tapping the pop-up will bring the user to the information page for the selected location. The information page displays an image, description, and details about the location. Buttons are also there for the future when 360Â° images are available.
